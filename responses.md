Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body? Every hour at home i will get away from the computer for 20 minutes. In class I do it every few hours instead
What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it? I have pretty bad adhd so timeboxing doesn't work very effectively for me however a modified version might be worth trying
On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments? Not seen them yet however based on the course learning material I think I should be ok
What are of you proud of up to this point in the course? Ig showing up? I have really bad social anxiety so this is way out of my comfort to do so
Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. I have several. As mentioned earlier I have adhd which affects how i study. I tend to study stuff I am interested in for days at a time without breaks. However on topics im less interested on this proves more difficult to do. For these topics I have a certain amount i need to do a day. My strategy works by learning a decent high level amount of a topic then details then i return to the high level view and see what i don't know and repeat. This is oversimplifying this but it has proven effective to learn lots of information in a relatively short time
If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say? It is day 2 for me technically so probably nothing of interest other than the overview of the assignment so i could start earlier
What is Python? Python is a high level, object orientated, interpreted language that has strong typing. It is good for easy prototyping and design although tends to fall short when speed or efficiency is required
Have you developed a habit of exploring? Definitely. I spend many hours every day researching programming related stuff and other interests in an effort to become better and more knowledgable with them
Have you meditated before? It is ineffective for me
Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take? I'm not sure if mastery counts but I am pretty good at dark souls. Rubik's cubes are easy although calling it mastery when you have memorized algorithms to solve them feels like cheating. Dark souls took 150 hours of play. I have far from mastered it though and have encountered resistance in a lvl 1 run and have been unable to practice as required due to pain in my hands
Do you consider yourself a developer yet? Not particularly. I haven't made any noteworthy projects yet
Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically? Creativity is incredibly important. Without it you wouldn't be able to come up with efficient solutions to problems. Stuff like binary space partitioning for example being used in doom was a pretty important choice although wasn't a common thing at the time but without it the game could not run. Fast inverse square root was another amazing example of creativity. By essentially taking the log of 1/sqrt(x) you can do several tricks to get to the answer. This however was in a paper published before quake 3. However using stuff like typecasting a pointer of a float to a long to do bitwise math on instead of dividing by 2 was a creative optimization (This is one of my favourite pieces of code)
How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs? Depends. Currently all study related however only 50% now study vs later study 
Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this? Printers/hj. Ive had issues with my printer not printing the right values. Was a firmware bug for that specific printer
What is an IDE? Integrated development environment. I personally avoid them and use vim, ranger and gcc for most tasks as this is more productive for me
What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge? I'm not sure what this is
Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them? N/A
So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you? Getting to the class. Scared because i struggle being around people especially people i don't know
What is OOP? Object orientated programming. I am not a fan of this myself however. I feel it is too often resorted to which makes code more unreadable and less maintainable. That's why i write c instead of c++
Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious? Idk what this is
Which parts of the work did you find tedious? Stuff I find too easy. Or stuff I have already done
What is polymorphism? I dislike oop but its an important principle in that. I am not super well versed in oop because of my distaste for it so my explanation would likely be lacking
Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said? I mean i have depression. To not be incredibly self critical would mean something major has changed
What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds? I am unsure which acronym this is. There are a few in programming that have this acronym
What is the hardest problem you have solved so far? I am not sure. Most problems are either difficult or not most in the latter category when programming is concerned
What is pair programming? I don't know
What are you looking forward to learning about programming? Probably the more high level stuff. I am usually fine with making all the complex parts of a project but am not great at combining them in a nice way. For example I have written 2 3d renderers before but actually implementing them with other game related stuff like characters, ui, quests etc is something i am unsure how to do in a way that i can easily expand the project
What is conscious listening? Making sure you are conscious of the conversation and your and the other person's feelings
What is a variable? It is a name for a location in memory which you can modify
What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why? C although i know a lot in that language i am constantly learning more. arm assembly (I know some x86 but they are different in several ways). Rust and zig
What is something kind that someone has done for you? One of my friends has started to teach me Serbian/Croatian 
If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say? It is a way to tell a computer how to do what you want it to do by using a series of keywords and numbers and other stuff. It is not just 1s and 0s although assembly is the closest most people will come to that
Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability? I already doubt my ability regardless of external influences
What is a fixed mindset? An unwillingness to learn and change your views if presented reasons to do so
What is something kind you have done for someone else? I am going to be teaching a friend c as their professor is doing a poor job
Have you done mindfulness or attention training before? ADHD. This stuff doesn't work much for me
Have you developed a habit of persevering? Definitely. I will keep going at something I don't understand until I learn and i enjoy challenges. I very rarely give up and if so its usually for an external reason like pain or deadlines
